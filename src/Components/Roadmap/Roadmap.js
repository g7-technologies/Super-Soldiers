              to Combat Stress, the UKâ€™s leading Veteran charity for mental health. Combat stress helps servicemen and
              women who suffer from mental problems such as: PTSD, depression and anxiety. A truly worthwhile cause and
              one that we feel very strongly about.

              homes to severely injured 9/11 Veterans, in order to give them an opportunity to rebuild their lives.

              floor. Some of the Super Soldiers picked up will be given back to the community in the form of giveaways and
              others will be used to increase the floor price.

              the final 10 ETH (or equivalent in dollars/pounds) should be donated to. This can be a British or US
              veteran charity as to keep in line with the project thus far.
